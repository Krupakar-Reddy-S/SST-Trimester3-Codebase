     * Fractional Knapsack allows you to take fractions of an item.

     * If Fractional Knapsack is not allowed, then we wil have to

     * 
     * But here we can take fractions of an item, so we can use Greedy Algorithm.
     * i.e. maximize per unit cost of an item and select from the array sorted,
     * use a custom comparator for sorting based on our logic.
