# OOPS Revision (Remedial)

### Why OOPS?

- **Procedural Programming**:

    - **Working**: 
        - In procedural programming, we write functions and call them in a sequence. 
        - It is difficult to manage the code as the code grows.
        - It is difficult to reuse the code.

    - **Solution**: 
        - We need to group the related functions and data together. 
        - This is where OOPS comes into the picture.

- **OOPS**:

    - **Working**: 
        - In OOPS, we group the related functions and data together. 
        - It is easy to manage the code as the code grows.
        - It is easy to reuse the code.

    - **Features**:
        - **OOPS has 1 Principle: Abstration and 3 Pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism**

        - **Abstraction**: 
            - It is the concept of hiding the complex implementation and showing only the necessary features of the object.
            - It helps the user to use the complex implementation details and use only the necessary features.

        - **Encapsulation**: 
            - It is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates.
            - It keeps the data safe from outside interference and misuse.

        - **Inheritance**: 
            - It is the mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the features of another class.
            - It supports the concept of reusability.

        - **Polymorphism**: 
            - It is the ability to present the same interface for different data types.
            - It is a way to perform a single action in different ways.

    - **Definitions**:

        - **Class**: 
            - It is a blueprint for the object.

        - **Object**: 
            - It is an instance of the class.

        - **Method**: 
            - It is a function that is associated with an object.

        - **Constructor**: 
            - It is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object.
        

### Need for OOPS

- **Example - PhonePe**:
    
    - **When Yes Bank which was behind PhonePe was Banned, PhonePe took less than 24hrs to get back up since their code was written with OOPS and Interfaces which could be reused for any other Bank for  their Services.**
