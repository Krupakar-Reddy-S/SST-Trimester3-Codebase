# Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It's about binding the data (attributes) and the methods that manipulate the data into a single unit known as a 'class'. It also involves hiding the details of how an object does what it does.

## What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation can be described as a protective barrier that prevents the data and code being randomly accessed by other code defined outside the class. Access to the data and code is tightly controlled through the interface.

- **Class:** A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. Class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe the behavior of an object.

- **Access Modifiers:** The encapsulation can be achieved in Java by declaring the class attributes as private and providing public setter and getter methods.

## Why Use Encapsulation?

Encapsulation offers several benefits:

1. **Control of data:** With encapsulation, you can control what parts of a program can access the members of a class. By controlling the access, you can prevent the data from being modified by accident.

2. **Increased security:** Encapsulation provides a way to protect your data from external misuse. Only methods of the same class can access its private fields.

3. **Flexibility and maintainability:** Encapsulated code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.

4. **Reusability:** Encapsulation also improves reusability and is easy to test.

In conclusion, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents data from being accessed and modified directly, thus is a way of ensuring data integrity.
