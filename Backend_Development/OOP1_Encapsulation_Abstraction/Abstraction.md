# Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows us to hide the complexity of a system and expose only the necessary details.

## What is Abstraction?

Abstraction involves creating simple models of complex real-world objects. In programming, we achieve abstraction through two primary ways: abstract classes and interfaces.

- **Abstract Classes:** An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to define common characteristics and behaviors that can be inherited by any subclasses. An abstract class can have both abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods (methods with a body).

- **Interfaces:** An interface is a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods. It defines a contract for what a class can do, without saying anything about how the class will do it.

## Why Use Abstraction?

Abstraction offers several benefits:

1. **Simplicity:** Abstraction allows us to hide complex details behind a simple interface. This makes it easier to use and understand the functionality.

2. **Modularity:** Each object is its own little island of code, which makes it easier to modify and debug.

3. **Reusability:** By defining common functionality in an abstract class or interface, we can reuse it in any subclasses.

4. **Maintainability:** With the right level of abstraction, code can be much easier to maintain and extend in the future.

In conclusion, abstraction is a powerful tool in OOP that helps us manage complexity by breaking down complex systems into simpler parts.
